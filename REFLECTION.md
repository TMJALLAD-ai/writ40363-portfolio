#My HW3 Reflection

<h3> Confidence Check: How confident do you feel about HTML after two weeks in WRIT40363? What specific skills feel solid, and what still feels challenging? <h3>

I feel confident with the commands we have learned so far. I still am a bit hesitant when it comes to file organization, VS code, and a few other processes more involved with setting everything up.

<h3> Learning Curve: Describe your experience learning Git and GitHub. What surprised you about version control? What part was more/less difficult than expected? <h3>

I think that Git/Github has been fairly easy to use. When we walked through everything, I never felt like I was simply following directions - it felt intuitive.

<h3>Problem-Solving Growth: When you encountered problems this week (code not working, Git confusion, etc.), how did you approach solving them? How has this changed since Week 1?<h3>

I feel that slowing things down as looking back on my previous work has helped a lot. Overtime, I hope that a lot of functions start to feel like muscle memory.

<h3>Professional Mindset: How do you feel about the transition from "just making web pages" to "developing professionally with semantic HTML and version control"? What excites or concerns you?<h3>

I am excited to see the potential of the things we will do with what we learn. I honestly was proud of creating a web page; it felt rewarding to see the work developed. 


<h3>Week 2 Reflection: What's your biggest "aha moment" or breakthrough from this week? What concept finally "clicked" for you? <h3>

Starting to get in the rhythm of using VScode and Github was brand new but rewarding when it felt natural. I also enjoyed the concept of previewing the work clicked well.

<h3>Looking Forward: Based on your experience so far, what aspect of web development are you most curious about or nervous about learning next?<h3>

I am curious how aesthetic changes will look like. Right now the basics seem to flow well, but I am looking forward to what the creative changes will be. 


<h3>Support and Resources: What's been most helpful for your learning so far (class discussions, hands-on practice, online resources, classmates)? What additional support might you need moving forward?<h3>

Hands-on practice has definitely helped a lot. I think if I had simply been listening to lectures rather than following along, I would have not retained much information.
