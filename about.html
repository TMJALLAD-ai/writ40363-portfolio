<h2>About Me</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I am from Flower Mound, Texas and graduated from Flower Mound High School. I have lived in Texas for 15 years. Before that, I lived in Minnesota from the ages 1-4, and before that I was born in North Carolina and lived there for one short year. I have one older sister who lives in Virginia, which is where a lot of my Mom's family lives. We usually travel to Washington D.C. because they live in cities very close by, and I enjoy spending time with family there - especially with my sister. </p>

<h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I am studying <strong>Business Information Systems</strong> with a minor in Digital Culture & Data Analytics. I enjoy learning about digital transformation and how automation can support a business or individual. I also would like to master data analytics and be able to communicate data to others.<p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>Aside from my studies, I enjoy spending time with friends and being active. I love working out, playing basketball, going for a walk, animals - especially my own, my pet bird <i>Zuzu</i>. I am also a resident assistant on campus where I get to meet a lot of different types of students and make all kinds of connections.

    <p>My other campus involvement includes being a member of Delta Sigma Pi (Business Fraternity), Frog Army (basketball spirit club), and the Sports Management Club. I attend most of the TCU athletics games and always look to find fun things to do on campus. </p>

 
<h3>Goals</h3>
    By the end of this class, my goal is to discover an area of DCDA that I am interested in that I had not considered before and pick up on the skills necessary to fulfill that area.
