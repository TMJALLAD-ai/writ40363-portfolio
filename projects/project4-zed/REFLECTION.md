# Project Zed Reflection: Budget Tracker

## What I Built and Why

I built a budget tracker that lets you add income and expenses, see your balance, and visualize it with a chart. I picked this I felt like budgeting has always been something I have needed a tool for, and there are plenty out there, but I figured I would be invested if I built it myself.

## Skills From Projects 1-3 That I Upskilled

### From Project 1 (HTML/CSS):
The CSS from Project 1 made a lot more sense this time around. This time I actually understand how it works. I also got more comfortable with CSS animations like the hover effects and the success message that slides in when you add a transaction feel way more polished than anything I did before.

### From Project 2 (JavaScript):
For this project, I split everything into four files—one for storage, one for transaction logic, one for charts, and one to tie it all together. This made debugging so much easier. When something broke, I knew exactly where to look instead of scrolling through hundreds of lines trying to find the problem.


### From Project 3
This project was about managing data myself—storing it, retrieving it, organizing it, displaying it different ways. Getting all those pieces to talk to each other was harder than I expected.

## How AI Changed My Development Process

Having Copilot available helped tremendously. Instead of getting stuck for hours on something, I could have it guide me out of there very quickly without just having the code handed to me.e.

That said, AI isn't perfect. At first it made the form require a category even for income with expense related cateogories like food or transport. I had to figure out how to fix that myself: make different fields show up depending on whether you pick income or expense. 

## What Surprised Me About Working With AI

The biggest thing was realizing how much better results I got when I was specific. Early on I'd ask stuff like "how do I set up charts" and get generic answers that didn't really fit what I needed. By the end I was like "I have this StorageManager object that gets transactions from localStorage, now I need a TransactionManager that calculates totals and updates the DOM, here's my HTML" I would receive much more useful code.


## What I Would Do Differently Next Time

- Test as I go: I wrote a bunch of code then tried to test it all at once, which made finding bugs harder
- Understand before moving on: A couple times I just accepted AI code without really getting it, then had to come back later and figure it out when I needed to change something

## How My Confidence as a Developer Has Changed

At the start of the semester, "coding" meant following tutorials and hoping things worked. Now I feel like I can actually solve problems.
This project proved to me that I can build functional things that can be useful to myself or others.
